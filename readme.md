To play the game you have to click in the map to do damage to the monster. After you kill the monster you will receive some exp and some zenys (the currency of the game).

When you get a lot of exp you will eventually level up ( yaay ) and that's when you can become much more stronger !!

In the attributes hud, you can upgrade each one of your attributes.

The level cap is 30/15. In the future patches, the level cap will be increased and new stuff will come. Can't wait to make them for you so you can play and have lots of fun !

## Run the project

To run locally you can download the repository and in the root folder you need to first install the dependencies and then you can run the project.

```bash
npm run install
```

These need two terminals open:
```bash
npm run front
```
```bash
npm run back
```

Or you can run the tasks to run both front and back with the `Frontend & API` task. (ctrl + shift + P, run task)
