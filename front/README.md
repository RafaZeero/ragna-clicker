## Todos

- [] Create level up mechanic to gain attributes points
- [] Add points in attributes points hud to get stronger
  - [] Define what will every attribute do. If I choose to go with them, I will have to add classes and stuff. Could be cool.
  - [] If I have 6 attributes, monster should have some powers to make players decide on which attribute they will make their build for.

## Ideas

- [] Create homunculus to farm exp while afk
- [] Create pet to loot items/gold while afk
- [] Add Party with limited number of participants to make different strategies to kill differents MVPs
- [] Toggle skills to auto-cast whenever the cooldown is 0 -> Maybe enable this when skill is level 5
- [] Add one or more apprentices when reach X base level / or do certain quest / or kill first MVP
- [] Make players buffs/skill more powerful than your teammembers buffs/skills
- [] Blockchain to create unique/special items in the game -> will need market to improve this
