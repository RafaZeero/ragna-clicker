## Ideas

- [] Create homunculus to farm exp while afk
- [] Create pet to loot items/gold while afk
- [] Add Party with limited number of participants to make different strategies to kill differents MVPs
- [] Toggle skills to auto-cast whenever the cooldown is 0 -> Maybe enable this when skill is level 5
- [] Add one or more apprentices when reach X base level / or do certain quest / or kill first MVP
- [] Make players buffs/skill more powerful than your teammembers buffs/skills
